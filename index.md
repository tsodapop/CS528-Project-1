## Project: UIC SEO Grove

[Project available on Github](https://github.com/tsodapop/CS528-Project-1)

This project is an interpretation of what the UIC SEO Grove can be utilized for. In this instance, the grove has been turned into a public space that promotes free play. The emphasis of the grove is a food-court style area, where people are able to order myriad food and drinks. Additionally, there is music and video games for entertainment. 

## How to use:

The project is run on Unity with emphasis on VR. The project can be run inside the CAVE2, located at UIC, or on the VIVE. The files under this repository will need to first be downloaded. The folder containing all of the files is named "Chicago-UIC." Additionally, the version of Unity will need to be 2019.2.11f1. [Visit Unity's webpage to look for older versions](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive).

- CAVE2: To run on the CAVE2, follow the directions provided by the wiki page on [uic-evl's github page on how to run in CAVE2](https://github.com/uic-evl/omicron-unity/wiki/Guide-for-running-Unity-in-CAVE2#building-on-cave2). 

- VIVE: To run on the VIVE, make sure that your VIVE is properly connected and set up. Open the project in Unity. Under Omicron in the top bar, click "Configure for Vive." After it is done updating, you can click the Play button and it should now be visible inside the VIVE.
