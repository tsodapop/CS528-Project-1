## Project: UIC SEO Grove

This project is an interpretation of what the UIC SEO Grove can be utilized for. In this instance, the grove has been turned into a public space that promotes free play. The emphasis of the grove is a food-court style area, where people are able to order myriad food and drinks. Additionally, there is music and video games for entertainment. 

## How to use:

The project is run on Unity3D with emphasis on VR. The project can be run inside the CAVE2, located at UIC, or on the VIVE.
